# MNIST-Digit-Recognition

### This project demonstrates the basics of computer vision using the MNIST dataset. It involves loading and preprocessing the data, building and training two models: a simple baseline model and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and evaluating their performance. The CNN model shows better accuracy compared to the baseline model, which is typical for image classification tasks.
